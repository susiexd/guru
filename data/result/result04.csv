345132,amazonaws.com:codeartifact,CodeArtifact," AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, and pip. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client.   <b>AWS CodeArtifact Components</b>  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:    <b>Repository</b>: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version"">package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI, the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), and <b> <code>pip</code> </b>.    <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain. The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages. Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.    <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html"">npm, <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html"">PyPI, and <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven"">Maven package formats. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:   A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a popular npm package)   An optional namespace (for example, <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)   A set of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)    Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)      <b>Package version</b>: A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning specification. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.    <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.    <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.   CodeArtifact supports these operations:    <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external connection to a repository.     <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.    <code>CreateDomain</code>: Creates a domain    <code>CreateRepository</code>: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain.     <code>DeleteDomain</code>: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories.     <code>DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy</code>: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain.    <code>DeletePackageVersions</code>: Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    <code>DeleteRepository</code>: Deletes a repository.     <code>DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy</code>: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository.    <code>DescribeDomain</code>: Returns a <code>DomainDescription</code> object that contains information about the requested domain.    <code>DescribePackageVersion</code>: Returns a <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageVersionDescription.html"">PackageVersionDescription object that contains details about a package version.     <code>DescribeRepository</code>: Returns a <code>RepositoryDescription</code> object that contains detailed information about the requested repository.     <code>DisposePackageVersions</code>: Disposes versions of a package. A package version with the status <code>Disposed</code> cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    <code>DisassociateExternalConnection</code>: Removes an existing external connection from a repository.     <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code>: Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. The token expires the authorization period has passed. The default authorization period is 12 hours and can be customized to any length with a maximum of 12 hours.    <code>GetDomainPermissionsPolicy</code>: Returns the policy of a resource that is attached to the specified domain.     <code>GetPackageVersionAsset</code>: Returns the contents of an asset that is in a package version.     <code>GetPackageVersionReadme</code>: Gets the readme file or descriptive text for a package version.    <code>GetRepositoryEndpoint</code>: Returns the endpoint of a repository for a specific package format. A repository has one endpoint for each package format:     <code>npm</code>     <code>pypi</code>     <code>maven</code>       <code>GetRepositoryPermissionsPolicy</code>: Returns the resource policy that is set on a repository.     <code>ListDomains</code>: Returns a list of <code>DomainSummary</code> objects.

An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.    <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.    <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances.     <b>Application revisions</b>: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.   This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.  <b>AWS CodeDeploy Information Resources</b>     <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide"">AWS CodeDeploy User Guide     <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/"">AWS CodeDeploy API Reference Guide     <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/index.html"">AWS CLI Reference for AWS CodeDeploy     <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=179"">AWS CodeDeploy Developer Forum   ",cloud,https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_awscloud_profile_image.png,https_twitter.com_awscloud_profile_image.png,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/codedeploy-2014-10-06.normal.json,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/codedeploy/2014-10-06/openapi.yaml,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/codedeploy/2014-10-06/openapi.yaml,345284,/amazonaws.com/codedeploy/2014-10-06/openapi.json

345140,amazonaws.com:discovery,AWS Application Discovery Service," AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/"">AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers:    <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.   Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.   Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.        <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.    The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.   The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.         <b>AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery agent.   Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API.   In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.      <b>Recommendations</b>  We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional information.  <b>Working With This Guide</b>  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs"">AWS SDKs. <note>   Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs.   You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.   API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.   Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is returned.   You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region.   </note> This guide is intended for use with the <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/"">AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide. <important> All data is handled according to the <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/"">AWS Privacy Policy.

345160,amazonaws.com:detective,Amazon Detective,"Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty. The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account. Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint. A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:   Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.   View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.   Add member accounts to a behavior graph.   Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.   A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:   View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.   Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.   Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.   Remove their account from a behavior graph.   All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events.

345177,amazonaws.com:appconfig,Amazon AppConfig," Use AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid. During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version.  AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples.    <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.    <b>Feature toggle</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.     <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content.     <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.

345195,amazonaws.com:codepipeline,AWS CodePipeline,"  <b>Overview</b>  This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html"">AWS CodePipeline User Guide. You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.  <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.  You can work with pipelines by calling:    CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.    DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline.    GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).    GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.    GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.    ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.    ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.    ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.    StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.    StopPipelineExecution, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline.    UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.   Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call GetPipelineState, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html"">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference. Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are:   Source   Build   Test   Deploy   Approval   Invoke   Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete. You can work with transitions by calling:    DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.    EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.     <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:  <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.  You can work with jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.    GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job.    PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.    PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.     PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.    <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network. You can work with third party jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.    GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a partner action.    PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.     PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.    PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.

345219,amazonaws.com:codestar-connections,AWS CodeStar connections," This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with connections and installations.  <i>Connections</i> are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection. When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one. When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections. You can work with connections by calling:    CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.    DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection.    GetConnection, which returns information about the connection, including the connection status.    ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your account.   You can work with hosts by calling:    CreateHost, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure where your provider is installed.    DeleteHost, which deletes the specified host.    GetHost, which returns information about the host, including the setup status.    ListHosts, which lists the hosts associated with your account.   You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the following:    ListTagsForResource, which gets information about AWS tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections.    TagResource, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections.    UntagResource, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections.

The API does not accept any data via query params.* The naming convention for endpoints is: localhost:8000/{VERSION}/{METHOD_FAMILY}/{METHOD_NAME} e.g. `localhost:8000/v1/connections/create`.* For all `update` methods, the whole object must be passed in, even the fields that did not change.Change Management:* The major version of the API endpoint can be determined / specified in the URL `localhost:8080/v1/connections/create`* Minor version bumps will be invisible to the end user. The user cannot specify minor versions in requests.* All backwards incompatible changes will happen in major version bumps. We will not make backwards incompatible changes in minor version bumps. Examples of non-breaking changes (includes but not limited to...):  * Adding fields to request or response bodies.  * Adding new HTTP endpoints.",developer_tools,https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_apis.guru_assets_images_no-logo.svg,https_apis.guru_assets_images_no-logo.svg,openapi,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/airbyte-api/src/main/openapi/config.yaml,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/airbyte.local/config/1.0.0/openapi.yaml,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/airbyte.local/config/1.0.0/openapi.yaml,345378,/airbyte.local/config/1.0.0/openapi.json

345234,amazonaws.com:config,AWS Config," Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by Config, see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources"">Supported Amazon Web Services resources. You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"">Signature Version 4 Signing Process. For detailed information about Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console, see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html"">What Is Config in the <i>Config Developer Guide</i>.",cloud,https://api.apis.guru/v2/cache/logo/https_twitter.com_awscloud_profile_image.png,https_twitter.com_awscloud_profile_image.png,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/master/apis/config-2014-11-12.normal.json,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/config/2014-11-12/openapi.yaml,https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/amazonaws.com/config/2014-11-12/openapi.yaml,345380,/amazonaws.com/config/2014-11-12/openapi.json
